# Contribution Guide 🦄

Thank you so much for wanting to contribute!

This document aims to inform you about how best to go about lending your time to the Pride in London ewb application.

## 🤔 What is this project about
Pride in London is an organisation that promotes diverse communities and events in London, UK. Each year there is one large Pride event in the Summer which entails an awfully large number of people and spectacular amounts of effort.

The broad goals are:

  - Integrate with a CMS so content can be managed without developer intervention
  - Modern, component based UI system to allow for future development
  - Create a platform allowing user contribution and moderation for future events
