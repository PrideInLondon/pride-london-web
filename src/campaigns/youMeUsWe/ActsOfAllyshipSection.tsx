        We are calling on each and every one of you who would have taken part in
        the festivities this month to make an act of allyship. Our goal is to
        reach 30,000 acts - one for every person who would have marched in the
        parade.

          Historically, the Pride movement was built on a core foundation of us
          standing up for one another. An attack on one of us is an attack on
          all of us, and from the Stonewall Uprising through to the present day,
          Pride has always been the moment we come together as a community in
          solidarity with one another.
        </P>
        <P>
          As LGBT+ people, especially those from marginalised communities,
          continue to come under attack from many sides, this allyship is as
          important now as it has ever been. Show your support for the rest of
          the community now and make an act of allyship.
