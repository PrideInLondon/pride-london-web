      This year, we want to document and celebrate those everyday acts of
      solidarity that embody the spirit of Pride â€“ the times when you've
      witnessed people standing up for the LGBT+ community by supporting you or
      those around you, whether they're a member of the community themselves or
      not.
    </P>
    <P>
      It could be someone taking a stand against bigotry and bullying, offering
      meaningful support during a difficult time, or helping you to feel
      accepted and loved when you needed it most. Whatever your experience of
      allyship, we want to hear about it!
    </P>
