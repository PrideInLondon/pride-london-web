          be better allies within our own community.

          We are calling on each and every one of you who would have taken part
          in the festivities this month to make an act of allyship. Our goal is
          to reach 30,000 acts - one for every person who would have marched in
          the parade.

            Historically, the Pride movement was built on a core foundation of
            us standing up for one another. An attack on one of us is an attack
            on all of us, and from the Stonewall Uprising through to the present
            day, Pride has always been the moment we come together as a
            community in solidarity with one another.
          </P>
          <P>
            As LGBT+ people, especially those from marginalised communities,
            continue to come under attack from many sides, this allyship is as
            important now as it has ever been. Show your support for the rest of
            the community now and make an act of allyship.
