      Although we may not be marching this year, now more than ever, we cannot
      lose sight of how important it is to support and celebrate our incredible
      community.

    <P>
      That's why we're taking our theme for 2020, #YouMeUsWe, online. It calls
      on each of us to reach out and understand one another, demanding us to be
      better allies within our own community.
