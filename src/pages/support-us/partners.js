              Without our dedicated and loyal partners, Pride in London simply
              would not exist. Since the current community group took over the
              running of Pride in 2012, the office of the Mayor of London and
              Barclays have remained committed to keeping Pride on the road.
              They have proved to be great allies of the LGBTQ+ community and we
              are eternally grateful for their support. In 2018, Sadiq Khan,
              Mayor of London extended Pride in Londonâ€™s contract, committing to
              support our work for a further 5 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many years LGBTQ+ people have faced hiding their true selves
              from their colleagues. Only since 2000 have people been able to
              openly serve in the military. Today, while prejudice is still rife
              in many places, many companies and organisations have embraced
              their LGBTQ+ members of staff. Studies show, that employers who
              recognise and support diversity are on average more productive and
              more profitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years we have seen more and more companies openly support
              and embrace their LGBTQ+ colleagues, as well as provide a safe,
              loving and supportive workplace. Being part of Pride is one of the
              many ways we are seeing workplaces transform for the better. Pride
              in London are proud to be working with our partners to ensure
              diversity is embedded in the core of each company we work with.
