          <p>
            We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal
            data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. If you
            change your mind and no longer wish to receive such communications
            or wish to change your preferences, you can opt out at any time by
            contacting us using the details provided below.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data
            to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be
            of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services
            and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
          </p>
          <p>
            You will receive marketing communications from us if you have
            requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us
            or if you provided us with your details when you entered a
            competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you
            have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
          </p>
          <h2>5. THIRD-PARTY MARKETING</h2>
          <p>
            We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your
            personal data with any third party company for marketing purposes.
          </p>
          <h2>6. OPTING OUT</h2>

          <h2>7. CHANGE OF PURPOSE </h2>
          <p>

            for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
            purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
            for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please
            contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated
            purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis
            which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your
            personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with
            the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

            your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal
            data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
            and the applicable legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal
            data are available in our retention policy which you can request
            from us by contacting us. In some circumstances you can ask us to

            circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no
            longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes
            in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
            further notice to you.

          <p>
            Access - The right to be provided with a copy of your personal data
            (the right of access).
          </p>
          <p>
            Rectification - The right to require us to correct any mistakes in

          <p>
            Restriction of processing - The right to require us to restrict
            processing of your personal data—in certain circumstances, e.g. if

          <p>
            Data portability - The right to receive the personal data you

          <p>To object - The right to object:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              at any time to your personal data being processed for direct
              marketing (including profiling);
            </li>
            <li>
              in certain other situations to our continued processing of your

              legitimate interests.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
            exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request
            in these circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us
            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
            data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
            measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
            who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
            for further information in relation to your request to speed up our
            response.
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
            Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
            particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
            case, we will notify you and keep you updated.{' '}
