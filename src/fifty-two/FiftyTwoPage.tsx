        Pride 2020 will be an altogether more arty affair than ever before...
      </P>
      <P>
        Why? Because for the first time The Festival will include in the
        month-long programme 'FIFTY-TWO', an exhibition celebrating Queer Art
        and spotlighting the work of LGBTQ+ artists.
      </P>
      <P>
        This is not, however, like so many other such events, the domain of an
        elite few - far from it! Curated by London artist, David Hodge (aka Miss
        Dusty O), this exhibition reflects a wide range of artists creating from
        various and diverse points of view.
      </P>
      <P>
        A panel of LGBTQ+ personalities and allies, curated by Dusty O herself,
        will select the 52 works on show - each representing a year since the
        first Pride Festival. The pieces will be showcased in a central London
        gallery during the month of July and will be available for purchase with
        some of the proceeds supporting Pride in London.
      </P>
      <P>
        As Pride in London - we are trying to ensure we constantly reach out to
        new communities and help shine the light onto our community and show the
        world what the LGBT+ has to offer. Letâ€™s make the community proud of its
        visual artists!
