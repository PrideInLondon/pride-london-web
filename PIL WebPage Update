About Us 


London LGBT+ Community Pride CIC, referred to as  ‘Pride in London’, is a volunteer-led non-profit organisation that organises the capital's official LGBT+ Pride. 

We welcome over 1.5 million spectators and 35,000 parade participants from a diverse range of LGBT+ community groups, organisations and partners who give bold visibility to what we have achieved, how far we have come and what we still need to do. 



Our Vision 



Our Mission 

Pride in London is our capital’s volunteer-powered LGBT+ force that unites our voice, amplifies our diversity and protest against inequality

Our Values 

Visibility 
Provide presence of LGBT+, across the city, physically & virtually

Unity
Provide nurture to London’s grassroots LGBT+ organisations 

Equality 
Provide platforms for both visible and invisible parts of our spectrum 


Our Diversity & Inclusion Pledge
At Pride in London, we recognise and value equality, diversity and inclusion. We will embrace, support and celebrate the difference of our volunteers, the spectrum of the LGBT+ community and the wonderful kaleidoscope of diversity that London has to offer.

We remain steadfast to our commitments to being an anti-racist organisation and accept that we must look in with humility, listen keenly, and act to effect real change.
